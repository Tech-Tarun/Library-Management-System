# Library-Management-System
Library Management System using Python
This is my first project on GitHub.
As the name explain itself, this project is based on a Library Management System.
We can see the number of books present in the library, issue the books, return them and even add new books to the list.
Every thing that we do, will be automatically updated in a text file, from where we will be able to fetch data for future reference.
